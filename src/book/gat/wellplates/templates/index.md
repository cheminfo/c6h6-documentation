## How to build your own experiment template?

The blank template is a csv file. In the template, each row corresponds to a well on the plate. The first and second columns of the file are assigned to define the corresponding row and column of the well to be detailed.  Additional columns will specify the concentration of the reagents used to perform the experiment and the user can add as many columns as reagents need in the experiment. The labels corresponding to the columns reagents may be edited as the user considers it appropriate.
