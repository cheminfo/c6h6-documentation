# Size and shape parameters

The tool automatically calculates the following size and shape parameters that are, for example, relevant for the toxicological assemement of nanoparticles following [Nanoreg](). 

## Size 

### Feret
The Feret parameters are equivalent to measuring the size with a caliper. 

## Shape

## ÏˆA (Aspect ratio) 
Is a measure of deviation from roundness that it not sentitive to "bumps". It is calculated as 

$$
 \psiA = \frac{Fe_{max}}{Fe_{min}}
$$

### Roughness 
Is a short-scale measure that is sensitive to "bumps". If the surface has more concavitites, the roughness decreases. 

Is calculated as 

$$

$$

### Roundness


### Sphericity
